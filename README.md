# Financial Modeling
The `financial_modeling` package contains a collection of financial modeling functions.

Simplicity and ease of understanding for educational use cases is my major goal for this package at the moment. Hence I didn't use any fancy libraries like `numpy` for better performance.  

The source code of this package is available at https://github.com/RezaBehzadpour/financial_modeling

## Install
To install the current release of `financial_modeling`, type the following command in terminal:
```bash
$ pip install -U financial_modeling
```

## How to use?
Here's how you can calculate simple **Arithmetic Return**:  
```python
>>> import financial_modeling as fm
>>> fm.ar(100, 140)
0.4
```
